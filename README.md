# cmdline.arguments
Welcome to the `cmdline.arguments` package. This package seeks to provide a fully implemented parser for commandline arguments, based on a fork of the [`argparser`][1] package version 0.6 (Thanks djhshih for his package). While several packages such as 
1. [`argparser`][1]
1. [`argparseÂ´][2]
1. [`docopt`][3]
1. [`getopt`][4]
1. [`GetoptLong`][5]
1. [`littler`][6]
1. [`optigrab`][7]
1. [`optparse`][8]
provide various interfaces to parsing command line argument these all are limiting in their customization. The [`argparser`][1] package currently seems to provide the most customizable interface, it has various issues when it comes to [custom arguments][9], [handling of multiple arguments][10] and provides only a very restrictive interface for custom arguments compared to the [`argparse`][11] module in [`python`][12]. In addition both [`argparse`][2] and [`argparser`][1] are very slow as one relies on [`reticulate`][13] and the other relies on the [`S4`][14] interface to [`as`][15].  
This package is a project to, in time, alleviate all of these problems, while providing a more general interface which allows the user to specify argument transformations in a similar manner to the [`argparse`][11] python module.

# Installation
To install this package one must currently use the `devtools::install_github` interface as 
```R
library(devtools)
install_github('bijaelo/cmdline.arguments')
```
In the future when the package is ready, it will be available on cran and we will be able to use  `install.packages('cmdline.arguments')` to install the package.

# Quick-start instructions
Using `cmdline.arguments` is very similar to the [`argparser`][1] package. As such we can simply do the following
```R
library(dplyr)
library(cmdline.arguments)
p <- parser(help = 'This is my first parser') %>%
  add_arguments('-f', '--foo', help = 'Some arguments', nargs = '?', type = 'integer', default = c(3, 4, 5))
args <- parse_args(p)
```
One difference from the [`argparser`](1) package is that `cmdline.arguments` is based on  [`R6`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=R6) objects. As such for users who prefer a more pythonic interface can use the `$` operator
```R
p2 <- parser(help = 'This is my first parser')
p2$add_arguments('-f', '--foo', help = 'Some arguments', nargs = '?', type = 'integer', default = c(3, 4, 5))
```
# cmdline.arguments vs argparser
One very sensible question comes why one would ever use this package over the 8 options listed above. Now I will not go over the details of every package, but will make a few examples here, illustrating the differences between this package and the [`argparser`][1] package. This will also describe many of the problems that occur when using the other packages.
## Custom argument types.
When it comes to creating creating custom inputs, the package author seem to suggest parsing the arguments as one of the known method, and post-handling arguments using functions. For example if a script has an non-negative integer argument, the suggested method is to do something like
```R
ap <- argparser::arg_parser(help = 'my parser') %>%
  add_argument('-f', '--foo', type = 'integer', help = 'non-negative integer')
args <- parse_arguments(ap)
if(!is.integer(args$foo) || args$foo < 0)
  stop('foo cannot be negative')
```
This becomes tiresome if one has to do this across multiple arguments, some of which may have multiple arguments. In python we can simply define a function or class, which takes care of error conversion and error handling.
```python
def pos_int(x):
  x = float(x)
  if(x < 0 or x - int(x) > 2**(-15))
    raise ValueError('x is not a positive integer!')
  return int(x)
import argparse
p = argparse.ArgumentParser(help = 'my parser')
p.add_argument('-f', '--foo', type = pos_int, help = 'non-negative integer')
args = p.parse_arguments()
```
Something similar is possible in [`argparser`][1] using `setAs`
```R
setClass('pos.integer')
as.pos.integer <- function(x){
  x <- as.numeric(x)
  if(x < 0 || x - as.integer(x) > 2 * .Machine$double.eps)
    stop('x is not a positive inteer!')
  x
}
setAs('ANY', 'pos.integer', as.pos.integer)
```
but while this method seemingly provides a complete method, it requires users to have a more in-depth knowledge of the R class system, and as [this issue][9] illustrates the underlying code in the [`argparser`][1] package is lacking in handling of this type of function. Now in `cmdline.arguments` we have the 3 options for the `type` argument
1. As in [`argparser`][1] we can use a single string specifying a function or `as` method
1. A function similar to [`argparse`][11] in python
1. A [`R6`][16] object, that should be returned after passing the argument as the first argument in `class$new`.
Each of these methods are carefully tested, and bugs are 

## Default arguments and multiple input arguments.
In both [`argparse`][11] in python and [`argparser`][1] it is easy to specify multiple arguments using the `nargs` argument in `add_arguments`. But while [`argparse`][11] in python consistently handles this, the R equivalent is filled with errors and even the `type` argument can end up being used for the wrong `inputs` as illustrated in [this issue][10] on their bitbucket page. The error comes in the underlying code which is build using long functions which become hard to manage and debug. In `cmdline.arguments` we opt to split code into multiple objects that each are self-contained. As such if we look at the structure of `arg_parser` and the arguments within, one notices that
1. `arg_parser` is an [`R6`][16] object, meaning it is an environment, containing functions/fields 
   1. `add_argument` used to add arguments
   1. `remove_argument` used to remove arguments
   1. `parse_arguments` used to parse commandline arguments.
   1. `arguments` used to extract a list of arguments added by `add_arguments`.
1. Each argument within `arguments` is itself an `R6` object, which contains fields
   1. `name`: the name of the argument
   1. `short_name`: the short name of the argument
   1. `dest`: the destination of the output list
   1. `parser`: the function, class or method used to parse the input argument from commandline.
   1. `arg`: If `parse_argument` has been called the parsed argument, otherwise the raw argument found from `commandArgs`. 
   1. `narg`: Similar to `nargs` in `add_argument`.
   1. `help` <!-- (Maybe this shouldn't be an R6 object, but instead be created using ) an [`R6`][16] object used to print the help message for the object. -->
1. The `help` object within each `argument` is a simple method used to build the help message for each specific argument. By default this object builds a message similar to 

## Customization of --help and messages.
Using [`argparse`][11] and [`argparser`][1] it is incridible difficult to customize how the help message is printed. I at least know of no simple method in Python and only digging deep into the `arg_parser` object itself. While few find a need to deviate from this behaviour, some may prefer more customizability or to alter how the message is build entirely.  
In `cmdline.arguments` the underlying printing methods is based on an [`R6`][16] object which contains two methods 
* `CreateMessage`: A function which takes a single vector argument of the form, `c(short_name, name, ...)` where `...` are any number of strings to be printed and stores the result in the `message` field of the object.
* `print`: A function called by the `print.help` function, which prints `message`, possible doing some pre-formatting before outputting it to console.

When building the `parser` object by default `getOption("cmdline.argparse.helpfun")` is used to create the help message, which creates a single line of input. Overwriting this option will overwrite how all input ( including '--help' ). Overwriting the `print.argument` and `print.parser` functions will let one further customize how these arguments are formatted and combined further.
